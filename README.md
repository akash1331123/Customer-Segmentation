## **CONCLUSION**

In this project, I performed unsupervised clustering.
I did use dimensionality reduction followed by agglomerative clustering.
I came up with 4 clusters and further used them in profiling customers in clusters according to their family structures and income/spending.
This can be used in planning better marketing strategies.

**Points to be noted:**

The following information can be deduced about the customers in different clusters.

About Cluster Number: 0

*   They are definitely a parent
*   At the max are 5 members in the family and at least 2
*   Majority of them have a teenager at home
*   Relatively older
*   A lower-income group

About Cluster Number: 1

*   The majority of these people are parents
*   At the max are 3 members in the family
*   They majorly have one kid (and not teenagers, typically)
*   Relatively younger

About Cluster Number: 2

*   Are a definitely not a parent
*   At the max are only 2 members in the family
*   A slight majority of couples over single people
*   Span all ages
*   A high income group

About Cluster Number: 3
*   Are a definitely a parent
*   At the max have 4 members in the family and at least 2
*   Single parents are a subset of this group
*   Most have a teenager at home
*   Relatively older

# Key Insights & Application:
#### Targeted Marketing: The profiling of customers based on family structure and income/spending allows for more personalized marketing strategies.
#### Income-Specific Offers: Low-income groups (Cluster 0) may respond better to budget-friendly promotions, while high-income groups (Cluster 2) may be more inclined to premium or luxury offerings.
#### Family Dynamics: Marketing efforts can also be refined based on family size, presence of children (especially teenagers), and parental status (e.g., targeting single parents in Cluster 3).

This detailed segmentation will help optimize marketing efforts, improve customer engagement, and increase retention by targeting specific customer needs based on their cluster profiles.
